# VSCode Theme Dark Minimalist

![Preview](assets/preview.png)

A variant of the VSCode standard theme Dark+ with fewer distractions from the code area.

Minimalist means fewer borders, fewer color and background variants but also a little more, comments and function parameters now use an italic font variant.

The font in the screenshot above is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
